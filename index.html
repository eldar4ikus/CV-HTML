    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I`m a highly motivated and driven individual, who managed to move to a different country, learn the german language and finish my bachelor`s in law and economics. After having a successful career so far in Talent Acquisition, I`ve decided to challenge myself and learn other languages such as JavaScript. At the moment I`m loving this new challenge and I`m looking forward to what the future brings.  </p>
